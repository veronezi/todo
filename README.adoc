== How to build it?

```
mvn clean install
```

== How to develop the UI.

First start the dependencies with...

```
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

The production application will be available at http://localhost

Now, from another terminal, start the react application (dev mode) with...

```
cd ui/src/main/node
npm install
npm start
```

This command above will open your browser automatically on http://localhost:3000

From now on, every time you change the source code under `ui/src/main/node/src`, the page at http://localhost:3000 will
be automatically updated.

In order to build the production code, run `mvn clean install` again.
