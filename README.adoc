== Whats in the box?

This project covers several different technologies used in the industry: docker, docker-compose, dockerize, travis, httpd,
docker-maven-plugin, JWT, Java, Microprofile, Jakarta EE, testcontainers, cucumber, nodejs, ReactJS, JSS, Javascript
etc. From backend to frontend; From test to production; If you understand all of it, you are a polyglot programmer.

=== `/api` and `/api-docker`

The `/api` submodule holds the restful application that contains all the business logic for this system. It's a standard
Jakarta EE application.

Here you will find examples of:

* Microprofile login configuration with JWT via `@LoginConfig`;
* Microprofile system configuration via `@ConfigProperty`;
* Microprofile JWT usage via `org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken`;
* `javax.ws`;
* `javax.persistence`;
* Lombok: `@Data`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, `@Slf4j` etc;
* Liquibase via CDI (http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/cdi.html);
* Unit tests with PowerMockRunner.

The `/api-docker` submodule is used to build a docker image with Apache TomEE for Microprofile and the restful
application created by `/api`.

Here you will see the first example of usage of the docker-maven-plugin from fabric8.

=== `/jwt-auth` and `/jwt-auth-docker`

`/jwt-auth` is a nodejs restful application used by the system as JWT provider.

It exposes two endpoints: `POST /auth` and `GET /publickey`.

The first endpoint is used by the `/api` application (here: `api/src/main/java/todo/api/ApiAuth.java`) whenever the user
tries to authenticate.

`/jwt-auth-docker` wraps the application above on it's own docker image.

=== `/thirdparty-docker`

This submodule contains all the thirdparty docker images that are shareable across our submodules. It currently contains
a custom docker image for `dockerize` (https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize - an amazing tool for running docker processes).

=== `/ui` and `/ui-docker`

`/ui` is the ReactJS application that builds the user interface. It's wrapped inside a maven module but it can still be used as
a plain nodejs application. See documentation bellow to see how this works.

`/ui-docker` is the module that builds the production-ready code out of the `/ui` source code and wraps it behind a
simple httpd server.

=== `/ft` and `/ft-docker`

`/ft` holds the functional tests for both backend and frontend. It's a `selenium`+`cucumber`+`testcontainers` testing
framework packed in a jar file. The tests are triggered by maven, but we can also run them via the `todo.ft.Main` class.

Here you will find examples of cucumber, selenium and test containers.

`/ft-docker` packages the functional tests in a docker image so we can run the tests from inside a docker network
(docker-compose or kubernetes, for example). You can see this working if you run `docker-compose up` from the root directory
of this project.

=== `/facade-docker`

This module builds a docker image with a httpd server that works as proxy for `/api-docker` and `/ui-docker`.

Here you will find examples of httpd's `RewriteRule`.

== How to build it?

```
mvn clean install
```

== How to develop the UI?

First start the dependencies with...

```
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

The production application will be available at http://localhost

Now, from another terminal, start the react application (dev mode) with...

```
cd ui/src/main/node
npm install
npm start
```

The command above will open your browser automatically on http://localhost:3000

From now on, every time you change the source code under `ui/src/main/node/src`, the page at http://localhost:3000 will
be automatically updated.

In order to build the production code, run `mvn clean install` again.
